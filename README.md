# Typescript-Domination
Welcome to TypeScript Domination, a repository where I'm documenting my journey as I dive into the fundamentals of TypeScript. Join me as I explore the language, from basics to advanced concepts, with hands-on examples and projects. Whether you're a beginner like me or looking to refine your skills, this repo offers insights into writing clean, efficient, and scalable TypeScript code. Let's master TypeScript together

# 1. Importance of import/export
Its a dummy export, its used  to make the file look like a module, cuse otherwise the Tyscript will make the variables of this file available gloablly to every "files", yes file, if they dont have any import and export
As inTypescript if any file is without  import and export, it will be available globally, so we need to make it look like a module, to prevent any conflict
